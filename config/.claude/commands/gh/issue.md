description: Create a well-specified GitHub issue through detailed interview
---

Use the write-issue skill to create a GitHub issue.

Before writing the issue, interview me in depth using the AskUserQuestion tool.
Ask about technical implementation details, UI/UX considerations, concerns,
tradeoffs, edge cases, error handling, dependencies, and anything else relevant.
Don't ask obvious questions—dig into the non-obvious aspects that would make the
difference between a vague issue and a well-specified one.

Continue the interview until you have enough detail to write a comprehensive
issue. Then write it.
