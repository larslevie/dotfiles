Help me find an Old English, Old Norse, or Anglo-Saxon name for a new Beamform service.

The service's purpose or function is: $ARGUMENTS

Following our naming philosophy inspired by Churchill's "Short words are best, and old words are best of all," please:

1. Run pre-commit checks as specified by the project's README.md or CLAUDE.md
2. Identify metaphorical concepts related to this service's function
3. Research etymology to find Old English/Old Norse/Anglo-Saxon roots
4. Suggest 3-5 potential names with:
   - The old word
   - Its literal meaning
   - How it relates to the service
   - Pronunciation guide if needed

Criteria:

- Prefer shorter words (1-2 syllables ideal)
- Must be reasonably pronounceable
- Should evoke the service's essence metaphorically
- Avoid overly literal descriptions

Example: For an auth service, we chose "Byrne" (Old English for "coat of mail") as it protects the system's identity layer.
